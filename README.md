# FreeCodeCamp-DynamicProgramming-Java
Solutions for the the FreeCodeCamp.org course on Dynamic Programming in Java.<br/>

## General Structure
Each problem has a differnet file that can be associated through the titles of the files. Every file should have three functions:
* Rec: General brute force based recursive functions
* Memo: Memoisation based function
* Tab: Tabulation based function


## Reason to make this
While going through this amazing course, I realised that translating from JavaScript to Java isn't as easy as it seems. I wasted a lot of my time initially in rectifying errors I made during translations, didn't want others to do the same. So, good luck! And happy learning!
